# gromgit's macOS FUSE stuff

This tap exists to support macOS FUSE-related software that have been dropped from Homebrew core.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/fuse/<formula>`

## Hey, why is XYZ not available?
Probably because I haven't gotten around to putting it in yet. If you need it, [file an issue](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-fuse/issues/new/choose) and I'll see what can be done.

## Hey, why is XYZ so old?
Maybe I just haven't gotten around to updating it yet, but a significant subset simply can't be updated until MacFUSE supports version 3 of the FUSE API. Read any _Caveats_ that appear during installation for important details.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
