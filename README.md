# gromgit's macOS FUSE stuff

This tap exists to support macOS FUSE-related software that will be dropped from Homebrew core at some point.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/fuse/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/fuse` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Hey, why is XYZ not available?
Probably because I haven't gotten around to putting it in yet. If you need it, [file an issue](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-fuse/issues/new/choose) and I'll see what can be done.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
